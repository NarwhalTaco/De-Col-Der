# DeColDer
A Wordle inspired color puzzle game.
This was my final project for my Programming 2 class
Ivan Yu, Albert Chen, Benjamin Cheung

Run DeColDerVFinal.java.

DeColDerVFinal.java is the only class that holds the entirety of the game, the logic behind it, and the GUI.

The input is just the buttons of the GUI windows and the output will be the game's functions of colors and text appearing on the GUI windows.
