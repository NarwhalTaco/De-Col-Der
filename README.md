# De-Col-Der
A Wordle inspired color puzzle game.

This was my final project for my Programming 2 class that I worked on with fellow classmates Albert Chen and Benjamin Cheung.

I worked on the game logic, the GUI logic, and debugging the game.

Run DeColDerVFinal.java.

DeColDerVFinal.java is the only class that holds the entirety of the game, the logic behind it, and the GUI.

The input is just the buttons of the GUI windows and the output will be the game's functions of colors and text appearing on the GUI windows.
